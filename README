== Backbone.js + Rails

This is a sample Multilevel app using Backbone.js. All this code is based in http://addyosmani.com/resources/backbonegallery/index.php
The app is rewritten with Ruby on Rails 3.1, and using the backbone-rails gem, all the styles and the html comes from the original app.
Clone it and see this running.
